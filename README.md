# Fourier-Neural-Operator

### Aim of this project ### 
This has been a smaller scientific group project about investigating the resolution invariance of a fourier neural opeartor (FNO) predicting Navier-Stokes dynamics. The project is based on the paper [Fourier Neural Operator For Parametric Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08895.pdf) by Zongyi Li et al. (2021)



The original code for this paper can be found on [Zongyi Li's GitHub repository.](https://github.com/ixScience/fourier_neural_operator/tree/master)
