# Fourier-Neural-Operator

### Aim of this project ### 
This has been a smaller scientific group project about investigating the resolution invariance of a fourier neural operator (FNO) when predicting Navier-Stokes dynamics. The project is based on the paper [*Fourier Neural Operator For Parametric Partial Differential Equations*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08895.pdf) (Zongyi Li et al., 2021).



The original code for this paper can be found on [ixScience's GitHub repository.](https://github.com/ixScience/fourier_neural_operator/tree/master)
